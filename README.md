The purpose of the API website is to search for Spotify
songs. 
The API key was taken from the official Spotify
website. 
When the website is opened the user will be
granted two drop-down menus: genres and playlist. 
When the user selects these two menus, a list of songs from that
genre and playlist will appear.
